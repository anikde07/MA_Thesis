R code for simulations and plots used in the Master's thesis - Time-Varying Individual-Level Fixed Effects: A Double Machine Learning Perspective

Simulations were run on a HPC-cluster. 
To replicate the code, simply download the repository 
and run the shell script on the server using `sbatch Run_"--- ".sh` where "---" is the name of the method you want to simulate.
