R code for simulations and plots used in the Master's thesis - Time-Varying Individual-Level Fixed Effects: A Double Machine Learning Perspective


Simulations were run on a HPC-cluster. To replicate the code, simply download the repository and use 'sbatch Run_"--- ".sh' where "---" is the name of the method you want to simulate.
